# 🧠 Employee Attrition Risk Prediction

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project comprises *1,470 employee records* across *35 columns*. It provides demographic, job-related, and behavioral insights that are essential for analyzing employee attrition.

### Key Features:

* *Age* – Age of the employee
* *Gender* – Male or Female
* *Department* – Business unit (e.g., Sales, HR, R\&D)
* *Job Role* – Position title within the organization
* *Monthly Income* – Employee’s monthly salary
* *Attrition* – Whether the employee left the company (Yes/No)
* *Job Satisfaction* – Satisfaction level (1 = Low, 4 = High)
* *OverTime* – Whether the employee works overtime
* *Years at Company* – Tenure with the organization
* *Education* – Education level (scale of 1–5)

## ❓ Problem Statement

Employee attrition is a critical concern in workforce management. High turnover rates lead to increased hiring costs, operational disruptions, and loss of valuable talent.

### 🎯 Objective:

To analyze HR data and *predict which employees are at risk of leaving* the organization using *data visualization* and *machine learning models*, thereby enabling timely and informed HR decisions.

## ✅ Project Workflow

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning using Power BI (Power Query)

Performed essential transformations to prepare the dataset for analysis:

* Removed irrelevant and redundant columns
* Renamed columns for clarity
* Converted data types (numeric, text, date)
* Handled missing values and removed duplicates
* Filtered for logical and relevant records

> *DAX Measures Created*:

* Total Employees
* Average Monthly Income
* Total Experience
* Employees by Department
* Income by Education Level

---

### 2. 📊 Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

An interactive dashboard was developed using the cleaned data, presenting:

* Total employee count
* Attrition rate
* Department-wise distribution
* Average monthly income
* Salary comparisons by education
* Experience metrics

This dashboard provides *a visual summary* of the organization's workforce status and aids *real-time decision-making*.

---

### 3. 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

Used Python libraries pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for visual analysis of attrition trends:

* *Attrition by Job Role* – Identified roles with high turnover
* *Attrition by Department* – Highlighted department-wise trends
* *Age Band vs Attrition* – Revealed age groups with higher attrition
* *Income vs Attrition* (Box Plot)
* *Distance from Home vs Attrition* (Box Plot)
* *Correlation Heatmap* – Detected feature relationships
* *Attrition Rate by Age Band* – Grouped percentage comparison

These visualizations provided actionable insights for feature selection and workforce planning.

### 4. 🤖 Machine Learning Implementation

Two supervised learning models were implemented:

#### 🔹 Model 1 – K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* *Features*: Age, Distance From Home
* *Preprocessing*: Feature scaling using StandardScaler
* *Classifier*: KNeighborsClassifier (n=5)
* *Evaluation*: Accuracy & classification report
* *Visualization*: Scatter plot to show attrition distribution

#### 🔹 Model 2 – Decision Tree Classifier

* *Features*: All relevant numeric and encoded features
* *Preprocessing*: Label encoding of categorical variables
* *Classifier*: DecisionTreeClassifier (max_depth=4)
* *Evaluation*: Accuracy & decision tree visualization

Both models were trained using a *70:30 train-test split* to evaluate performance.

## 💡 Conclusion

This project provides a *complete pipeline* for understanding and predicting employee attrition using:

* *Power BI* for data cleaning and dynamic dashboards
* *Python* for in-depth exploratory data analysis
* *Machine Learning* models (KNN, Decision Tree) for prediction

By identifying high-risk employees, organizations can take *proactive retention measures*, reduce turnover, and improve workforce stability.
